Welcome! My name is Sam Paredes (CoffeeJunkie), I am a cybersecurity student originally from Colombia and currently living in the US.

My main interests include penetration testing, malware analysis, OSINT, and programming. However, I always enjoy building and breaking all sorts of systems. I'm currently working towards new projects related to OSINT research, pentesting, and malware analysis.

In this website you will find resources and projects related to the interests mentioned above. 

If you have further questions do not hesitate to contact me.
